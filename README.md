# WebProject

We had developed a website for Northeastern University's International Student's Assistance wing. This was setup mainly to provide early assistance to incoming international students, like pick-up from the airport, temporary accommodation,etc. 
We identified the problem scenario and provided a means of easy access of services to the students to avail them.

The website consisted of 2 roles:
Student role : Students can register with their official university email ids for the services
Admin role : Admin can assign volunteers to students who have registered, add volunteers

The website consisted of static pages, providing information about the team and services for unregistered users as well. 
Registered user's data was stored in MySQL database.
